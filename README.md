## Project Overview
Discord is a VoIP and instant messaging platform and Discord bots are AI-driven tools that can help you automate tasks on your Discord server. Using our bot Foodie-Fi, one can start their own private thread, and then provide with the bot commands to start the procedure. <br/><br/>
You’ll need to enter the city name, restaurant name and food item you want to order, and then the bot will process through the various web apps and provide you with the price on each of the apps, where the item is available, along with the redirect url of the website, to take you on the site where you want to place the order on. <br/><br/>
**Unique Selling Point**: The comparison web applications online are usually very less user friendly, here we are creating a discord server where all you’ve to do is enter the product name and it will provide the price on various food ordering apps, depending on the availability

## Motivation
According to a news article, titled “The great Indian food delivery tussle” on The Hindu, ‘Restaurateurs (as well as organizations like National Restaurants Authority of India, NRAI) have for years been seeking alternatives to mainstream aggregator apps. Statements galore have been made about how the deep discounts offered by delivery apps, combined with heavy commissions they charge, cut deep into profits of restaurants, bars and cafes, to the point of making business nearly unsustainable.’ <br/><br/>
This has led to the emergence of alternatives to mainstream food delivery websites (Swiggy and Zomato), like, Thrive, DotPe and Rezoy. With so many options to order a single item on the wide sea of internet, it’s often tiring for customers to make their choice. With this perspective, we decided to build our own Discord Bot, Zwiggato.
